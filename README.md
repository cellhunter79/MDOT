## Issues to solve
### White noise experiments
    1. Increase frame rate in white noise stimulation
      Requiments: > 15 fps
      Possible solutions:
        Solution 1. Use psychopy3  
        Solution 2. Refactor code
        Solution 3. Use new strategy: 
            Creat a movie first
            Annotate the timing of stimulus in a seperate file.
            Compare response time with the annotation

    2. Turn background to back and set as full screen

    3. Test on desktop experiment computer
    
### Road video experiments
